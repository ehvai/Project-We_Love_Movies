# Project-We_Love_Movies

This project is the backend for a movie review and theater site.  The purpose of the site is to allow the user to take a look at movies that are currently playing in a list og theaters.  They are also able to leave reviews on those movies.

The backend portion is where the API is created that pulls that information from a database.
The tools used were Express and Knex with JavaScript.

The front end was created by Thinkful.
